# Project Outline:

Home Page allows a visitor to register 
Once logged in (or registered for the first time) user is sent to Dashboard with the options of creating, editing, or deleting listings or rentals
Login/Logout authentication
Any user can see all current listings & rentals and contact the listing agent, view more details about the property, and view any photos associated with listing
Mobile-first, fully responsive design
Handling of photo upload/storage/deletion is done thru FileStack
Features made-from-scratch responsive, mobile-friendly navbar with drop-down menu for smaller screens (much simpler stand-alone example found here)
Grid system for layout is also "home made" without using any external grid systems such as Bootstrap (simple example found here)
